# ExecView – UI Mock-up (no backend)

A polished, front-end only mock-up for executive client reporting and KPI review.

## What’s included
- **PAM workspace**: fast weekly per-client updates + monthly rollup fields
- **GM dashboard**: portfolio KPIs, attention/stale/commercial lists, drill-down drawer
- **Pre-populated demo data**: 20 realistic imaginary enterprise clients
- **No backend**: data stored in browser localStorage for demos

## Run
Open `index.html` directly, or run a tiny local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

## GitHub Pages
Push these files to a repo root and enable Pages (main / root). The mock will run as a static site.
